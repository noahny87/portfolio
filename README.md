## About Me

Hi, I'm Noah! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior at North Dakota State University pursuing a Bachelor's in Management Information Systems with a minor in Applied Statistics and a Business Analytics certificate. Currently, I'm working as a Business Intelligence Analyst intern at Bobcat.

I have a passion for data science, machine learning, and using technology to solve real-world problems. My experience ranges from building machine learning models to developing business intelligence dashboards that drive insights.

I love working on projects that challenge me to learn new skills, and I'm constantly improving my technical abilities. Right now, I'm focused on developing my expertise in Machine Learning and data analytics as I complete my degree and master's program.

Feel free to check out my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- **[Pokemon LLM using RAG](https://github.com/noahny87/Pokemon-Chat-Bot-using-RAG)**  
  As a huge fan of PokÃ©mon and the franchise, I wanted to create my own "PokÃ©dex" similar to what you see in the show. Using a dataset from Kaggle and Meta's Llama family of LLMs, I brought the concept to life. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this project can retrieve and present information about various PokÃ©monâ€”just like a real-life PokÃ©dex!

- **[Anime Recommendation](https://github.com/noahny87/Anime-Recommendation)**  
  As a huge anime fan, I often wondered how recommendation systems like those used by Netflix, Hulu, and MAX actually work. To satisfy my curiosity, I decided to build my own! I started by diving into cosine similarity, which proved to be more robust than Euclidean similarity for this task, and it became the core recommendation function. Using Word2Vec embeddings, I created vectors for each show and ran them through cosine similarity to retrieve accurate recommendations.

  One major challenge was the inconsistency in naming conventions (e.g., "Naruto Shippuden" is often just called "Naruto"). To tackle this, I implemented a closest-match search to eliminate errors caused by name discrepancies. In the end, the system worked seamlessly, delivering accurate resultsâ€”a job well done!

  As Spike Spiegel from *Cowboy Bebop* would say, "Whatever happens, happens"â€”and this project taught me a lot about problem-solving and persistence!


- **[Store Forecasting Competition - Rohlik](https://github.com/noahny87/Projects-Competition)**  
For this Kaggle competition, I used a LightGBM model to predict store sales. The model achieved a **4.4% error (MSE: 0.0440)**, placing **37th** on the leaderboard out of hundreds of participants. LightGBM was selected for its efficiency in handling weak correlations within the dataset and for requiring less computational power compared to XGBoost.
